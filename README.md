# Cricket Score Prediction using Machine Learning



## Acknowledgements

The purpose of this study is to develop a
method for predicting game outcomes during an ODI cricket
competition. Like all other papers we adopted the factor based
prediction meaning the prediction will depend on various game
factor.
## Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Xgboost and Random Forest
